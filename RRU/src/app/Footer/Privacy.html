        RentersRus.com reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into RentersRus.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).

                4. Use of Web Beacons or GIF files
            </h4>
        </div>

        RentersRus.com Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow RentersRus.com to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.  RentersRus.com may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

        Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications.  These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer.  This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site.  RentersRus.com prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
